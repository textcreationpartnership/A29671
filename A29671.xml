            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>or elſe believe me for the very works ſake.</hi> We read, that when God offered a ſigne or miracle unto <hi>king Ahaz,</hi> to the end that he might believe the words which were ſpoken unto him by the mouth of the <hi>prophet Iſaias,</hi> he refuſed, ſaying, <hi>I will not ask,</hi>

The <hi>Phariſees</hi> were a generation of proud hypocrites, who had before hand ſet up a reſolution not to believe on him, whatſoever he ſhould ſay, or whatſoever he ſhould do: therefore when they require a <hi>miracle,</hi> out of pride and curioſity, they are condemned and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected. But <hi>Gideon</hi> in his humility did aske a ſigne, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of his faith in the promiſe of <hi>God.</hi> It is no example for us now; for the <hi>goſpell</hi> is ſufficiently confirmed by <hi>miracles,</hi> we muſt believe, and have recourſe unto the ordinary ſignes: the <hi>ſacred and mysterious ſacraments.</hi> To refuſe or contemn them is the ſin of <hi>Ahaz.</hi> Laſtly they make for the <hi>glory of God,</hi> becauſe thereby he breaks the <hi>ſerpents</hi> head, and deſtroyes his kingdom.

               <note place="margin">Sins remitted by God au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatively</note> He againſt whom ſins are committed, to him it doth belong to forgive ſins <hi>proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and by his own authority; but this is <hi>God,</hi> and none but <hi>God,</hi> the breach of whoſe laws and commandments are <hi>properly ſins,</hi> (for as much as the offence done to any man, or to any other creature, is no more but an offence or injury; nay, for as much as the breach of any <hi>mans commandment,</hi> is no ſin, unleſs it imply with all, the breach of the <hi>commandment of God</hi>) Therefore to <hi>God,</hi> and to none but <hi>God,</hi> doth it belong to forgive ſins <hi>properly,</hi> and by his own <hi>authority.</hi> This is clearly evinced by the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> who although he had treſpaſſed highly againſt <hi>Uriah,</hi> in that he had defiled his wife, and cauſed him to be done to death,<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.4.

               <hi>Saint John the Baptiſt was fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the holy Ghoſt even from his mothers wombe.

Then are we juſt when we confeſſe our ſelves to be ſinners, and our righteouſneſſe doth not conſiſt of our own merit, but of the mercy of God. <hi>Hieron. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>adver. Pelag. Zacharias</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> were both righteous before <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Saint John the Baptiſt</hi> was filled with the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> even from his mothers wombe.

<pb n="228" facs="tcp:65135:118"/> I do not deny but that many of the dear <hi>Saints of God</hi> even in this life, do walk in all the commandements and ordinances of the <hi>Lord blameleſſe</hi> to the world and to men: though not blameleſſe to <hi>God.</hi> Blameleſſe to the world and to men, becauſe without <hi>crime;</hi> not blameleſſe to <hi>God,</hi> becauſe not without <hi>ſin.</hi> Excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Saint Auguſtine</hi> in his <hi>Enchiridion</hi> to <hi>Laurentius; Neque enim</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>quia peccatum eſt omne crimen, ideo crimen eſt omne pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum;</hi> It doth not follow, that becauſe every crime is a ſin, that every ſin is alſo a crime.
